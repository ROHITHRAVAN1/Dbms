db for hotel management using oracle sql
Here we had taken a hotel management system because now a days the
tourism is one of the most popular and economical benefit for a place. As the
tourism increases the place needs to be accomplished with the hotels for
allocating the people comfortably.
 Here we propose an online webpage where the user can find hotels
 This helps the customer to know the prices of the rooms available in the
hotel and the hotel location and facilities.
 So we wanted to create a webpage which would help them keep track of the
room availability and we will also daily send newsletters which will be
helpful to our customers.
 The webpage needs a good database to be connected with it to work
efficiently.
 So here in our project we are going to present a database that helps the
webpage to make it available and efficient to the users.
 By encapsulating our database design to the webpage one can be able to
build up a web application with front end and back end setup correctly
 Languages and Frameworks used for front-end:
 HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, JAVASCRIPT
 Languages and Frameworks used for back-end:
 PHP
 Database: MYSQL.
Functional Requirements and Conceptual view of the Database Design;
 Our webpage contains a registration page where the user can register with (
name, password ,email ,gender ,address).
 Also contain login page where the user is able to login and get to know
about rooms available, room rents, payment methods available, Wi-Fi
credentials.
 The user can also see the gallery of the hotel where the hotel interior and
exterior shown beautifully.
 Here the database is needed to store the hotel room details, to store the users’
details and to store the rooms that are booked by the customer.
 Here thereby we need the entities like admin, user details, room registration
details, food order detail, and staff in hotel.
 Here we design the E-R Diagram for our better conceptual view and from
the entity diagram we are able to know in depth about each entity type.
